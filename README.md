MCP Server

1. What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for interaction between models, agents, and contextual data. It is developed and maintained by the community. More details can be found in the official repository: MCP GitHub.

2. What is IPFS?

InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed file system that enables decentralized data storage and sharing. It is used in MCP for storing and interacting with data, ensuring reliability and fault tolerance.

Deployed IPFS

A pre-deployed IPFS instance is available at: http://3.25.111.209:5001/. Installing a local IPFS instance is not required.

3. MCP Server Architecture Overview

Components:

MCP Node — the core server component that processes MCP requests.

IPFS — a decentralized storage system for handling content.

Client — interacts with the MCP server to send and receive data.

Claude AI — used for processing and enhancing MCP interactions.

Component Interaction:

The client sends a request to the MCP node.

The MCP node processes the request and interacts with IPFS if necessary.

Claude AI assists in processing and optimizing responses.

The response is returned to the client.
